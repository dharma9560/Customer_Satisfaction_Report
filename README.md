# Customer Satisfaction & Loyalty Analysis (Power BI)

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes customer satisfaction and loyalty across different demographic groups, regions, and support experiences. The goal is to uncover key drivers of satisfaction, identify loyal vs. at-risk customers, and support data-informed decision-making for customer retention.

## Overview

Using a cleaned and enriched dataset, the report categorizes customers by:
- **Satisfaction Score** (on a 1â€“10 scale)
- **Loyalty Level** (High, Medium, Low)
- **Purchase Frequency Group** (Frequent, Regular)
- **Support Interaction** (Contacted or Not)
- **Demographic Attributes** (Age, Gender, Region)

- Calculate key KPIs including:
  - **% Loyal Customers**
  - **% At-Risk Customers**
  - **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**
  - **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
- Visualize **satisfaction distribution** and **loyalty segments**
- Provide actionable insights for **customer engagement strategies**

   - Created satisfaction levels from CSAT scores  
   - Grouped customers into age groups  

3. **Data Modeling in Power BI**  
   - Created relationships and DAX measures  
   - Added calculated columns and tables for segmentation  

4. **Report Design**  
   - Used cards, bar charts, donut charts and stacked column charts  
   - Applied dynamic filters for Region, Gender, State, etc.  
   - Visuals colored to reflect sentiment (Green, Yellow, Red)
