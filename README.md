# Customer Satisfaction & Loyalty Analysis (Power BI)

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes customer satisfaction and loyalty across different demographic groups, regions, and support experiences. The goal is to uncover key drivers of satisfaction, identify loyal vs. at-risk customers, and support data-informed decision-making for customer retention.
